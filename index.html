    <h2 class="sectionTitle">User Research</h2><br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">User Interviews</h3>
    <p>I partnered with a classmate, Nicole Tierney for the user research portion of this case study. We began our research with a proto persona to act as a hypothesis. We then conducted 6 user interviews to determine how people plan for a vacation.</p>
    <div class="quoteSection">
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“Too many people just makes planning and doing the activity too difficult. I would rather be in a small group than alone, but I would rather be alone than try to plan and do things with a large group.”</p>
      <br>
      <p class="quotee">Sean, 31</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>“More streamlined communication would be great in a group setting. It can be difficult in terms of making quick decisions so you're not going back and forth a bunch, asking a ton of questions and potentially missing out on something because it took too long for the group to decide.”</p>
      <br>
      <p class="quotee">Mary, 29</p></div>
    </div><br>
    <p>During our user interviews, we discovered that 83% of our participants find meeting the expectations of their fellow travelers to be the most difficult part about paired/group travel planning. Therefore, I believe that group travelers desire a less stressful way to collaborate with their travel companions and that I might help if I develop an app that facilitates decision-making for travel planning. How might we simplify the planning collaboration process so that each our of users feel represented in their group’s choices for travel accommodations and activities?
      </p><br>
      <h3 class="specTitle">User Persona</h3>
      <p>Based on the feedback from our user interviews we developed a user persona that represents the needs of our users. Meet Marion. </p>

    <h3 class="specTitle">User Insight</h3>
    <p>During our user interviews, we discovered that 83% of our participants find meeting the expectations of their fellow travelers to be the most difficult part about paired/group travel planning. Therefore, I believe that group travelers desire a less stressful way to collaborate with their travel companions and that I might help if I develop an app that facilitates decision-making for travel planning. How might we simplify the planning collaboration process so that each our of users feel represented in their group’s choices for travel accommodations and activities?</p>    
    <br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>Travelers like Marion need an easier way to make decisions about travel accommodations and activities that enables streamlined collaboration between multiple people.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">I Like, I Wish, What If</h3>
    <p>I then brainstormed using the “I like, I wish, what if” ideation model with our user persona as my north star. Myself and one of the users I previously interviewed during the research process then selected the concept in each column that we liked most.</p>
    <p>Because our selections didn’t overlap, I went back through each concept and grouped them by topic or commonality. My interviewee and I then picked two groups each that spoke to us. Organization Ease and Recommendations were selected by both parties. Next I used a Feature Prioritization Matrix to identify which features to focus on for my initial prototype.</p>

    <h3 class="specTitle">Value Proposition</h3>
    <p>Swivel is a travel planning app that allows users to browse and vote on potential accommodations and activities with their chosen travel companion(s). </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">User Storyboard</h3>
    <p>I then developed a User Scenario, then a User Journey Map, which in turn developed into a Storyboard.</p>
    <p>Marion is planning a trip for a group of her friends. She wants to make sure everyone's needs and expectations are met. She also wants to make sure everyone feels heard in the planning process.</p>
    <p>In comes the app, Swivel. Swivel allows each tripmate to swipe through their travel options in order to vote yes or no. </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Prototyping</h2><br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">Competitor Analysis</h3>
    <p>Before I developed my initial sketches and wireframes, I conducted a competitor analysis to see how other travel apps solve similar user problems. I included Wanderlog, Travefy, TripIt and Poll for All on my competitor analysis.</p> 
    <p>Wanderlog and Travefy were more closely related to the app I was trying to develop. However, their primary features were organizing and sharing itineraries. Neither app had a solution for making initial group travel decisions.</p>

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">User Flow</h3>
    <p>Next I developed a User Flow to inform my initial sketches and wireframes for Swivel. My user flow takes the user through onboarding, selecting a travel destination and dates, adding trip mates, applying filters and viewing results.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">Sketch to Wireframes</h3>
    <p>I made my initial sketches on paper just to get my ideas down and make sure the User Flow works as expected.</p>
    <p>I turned those paper sketches into a clickable prototype in Figma. Then I iterated and created new digital wireframes in Figma.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Testing and Iteration</h2><br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">User Testing</h3>
    <p>I tested my digital wireframe with 6 users; iterating between each interview based on the user’s comments and interactions with the prototype.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bold">Objectives:</p>
    <p>A. Can users add guests to their trip?</p>
    <p>B. Are users able to vote yes or no on results and do they find value in this feature?</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bold">Tasks:</p>
    <p>1. Search for accommodations in Denver, Colorado.</p>
    <p>2. Add a guest to your trip</p>
    <p>3. Apply filters and vote on the results</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="specTitle">Testing Results</h3>
    <p>All 6 users were able to complete all 3 tasks with ease. However, I still received some great feedback and was able to iterate based on their interactions.</p>
    <p>Although the 1st user completed each task with ease, I sensed they didn’t understand that they are browsing and voting with their trip mates. As I intended this to be the primary feature of the app, I continued to iterate the prototype until users highlighted the app’s features without prompting.</p>
    <div class="quoteSection">
      <div class="quote cream">
        <p>“It was all intuitive!”</p>
        <p>“This would be great for me and my wife. We have been putting off planning our next trip, this would make it easy.”</p>
        <p>“Easy to use.”</p>
      </div>
        <div class="quote cream">
          <p>“Which way do I swipe for yes again?” ”</p>
          <p>“Oh, so Tinder rules? I get that. Makes sense. Swiping gives you a little dopamine hit.”</p>
          <p>“You can scroll on this page?” [in reference to match results]</p>
        </div></div>
        <br>
        <h3 class="specTitle">Iteration</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I made several iterations between the 2nd and current version of my match screen page. Updates include moving non-matches to the bottom of the screen, lowering the opacity of non-matches so not to pull focus from matches, and putting the match details within an accordion section.</p>
       <p>I also added a success message after a trip mate is added to further confirm to the user that they are planning along with a friend.</p><br>
